<h1><i>Comet's Burial</i><br />

<small><i>by</i> RAYMOND Z. GALLUN</small></h1>

<div class="cap">OUTSIDE Tycho Station on the Moon, Jess Brinker showed Arne
Copeland the odd footprints made in the dust by explorers from
Mars, fifty million years ago. A man-made cover of clear plastic
now kept them from being trampled.</div>

<p>"Who hasn't heard about such prints?" Copeland growled laconically.
"There's no air or weather here to rub them out&mdash;even in eternity.
Thanks for showing a fresh-arrived greenhorn around..."</p>

<p>Copeland was nineteen, tough, willing to learn, but wary. His wide
mouth was usually sullen, his grey eyes a little narrowed in a face that
didn't have to be so grim. Back in Iowa he had a girl. Frances. But love
had to wait, for he needed the Moon the way Peary had once needed
the North Pole.</p>

<p>Earth needed it, too&mdash;for minerals; as an easier, jump-off point to
the planets because of its weak gravity; as a place for astronomical
observatories, unhampered by the murk of an atmosphere; as sites for
labs experimenting in forces too dangerous to be conducted on a heavily-populated
world, and for a dozen other purposes.</p>

<p>Young Copeland was ready for blood, sweat, and tears in his impulse
to help conquer the lunar wastes. He sized up big, swaggering Jess
Brinker, and admitted to himself that this man, who was at least ten
years his senior, could easily be a phony, stalking suckers. Yet, Copeland
reserved judgment. Like any tenderfoot anywhere, he needed an
experienced man to show him the ropes.</p>

<p>He already knew the Moon intimately from books: A hell of silence,
some of it beautiful: Huge ringwalls. Blazing sunlight, inky shadow.
Grey plains, black sky. Blazing stars, with the great blurry bluish globe
of Earth among them. You could yearn to be on the Moon, but you
could go bats and die there, too&mdash;or turn sour, because the place was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>too rough for your guts.</p>

<p>Afield, you wore a spacesuit, and conversed by helmet radiophone.
Otherwise you lived in rooms and holes dug underground, and sealed
up. The scant water you dared use was roasted out of gypsum rock.
The oxygen you breathed was extracted from lunar oxides by a chemical
process. Then air-rejuvenator apparatus reseparated it from the carbon-dioxide
you exhaled, so that you could use it over and over.</p>

<p>Copeland had read the tales: With that kind of frugality as the price
of survival, lunar prospectors could turn selfish to the point of queerness.
Afraid somebody might follow them to their mineral claims, they'd
take more pains to leave as little spoor as possible than a fox being
tracked by dogs.</p>

<p>"Speaking of how footprints last around here," Copeland remarked for
the sake of conversation, "I understand you've got to be careful&mdash;stick
to high ridges, and to parts of the flat <i>maria</i> where there's no old volcanic
ash or dust of thermal erosion."</p>

<p>"Guys who do that are misers and old women, kid," Brinker scoffed.
"Hell&mdash;it sure ain't because they're modest that they're so cautious!
Me&mdash;I do things right."</p>

<p>He lifted a foot from the dust beside the path, revealing the mark
of the specially etched steel sole of his spaceboot. A name was stamped
across the print: BRINKER.</p>

<p>"I'm proud of where I've been and where I'm going&mdash;like a true
explorer," the big man said. "Get some soles like mine made for yourself,
fella, and come along with me."</p>

<p>Copeland was intrigued. "Let me think about it a little."</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<div class="cap extraspacetop">DURING the next few hours he heard quite a lot.</div>

<p>A big, blonde nurse&mdash;one of the two women in the sealed
warrens of Tycho Station, said: "Young man, I <i>love</i> Jess Brinker. But
keep away from him, or you'll wind up in the prison pits, or worse."</p>

<p>And Copeland heard about Tom Brinker, Jess' dad&mdash;the kind of
swindler always found in rough new territory, anywhere. He had promoted
the idea of a real city on Lunar. Yeah&mdash;one with trees and
flowers. What sentimental bait that was for home-starved, desolation-sick
wanderers! No wonder somebody had murdered him recently.</p>

<p>By common opinion, twenty-odd years was the only difference between
Jess and his father. "Stay clear," was the warning; the name of
Brinker was mud and poison.</p>

<p>Arne Copeland was a cagey youngster; nobody influenced him when
he made up his mind. He was no cow-eyed hero-worshipper; yet, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
his own, he kind of liked the large, battered, egotist. Copeland knew
that he was an egotist himself. He also knew that merely to be on the
sketchily-explored Moon was to take chances.</p>

<p>So he said "Okay," to Brinker, and got some metal boot-soles made,
with his name etched into them in reverse, as in a rubber stamp.</p>

<p class="extraspacetop">Under packs that no coolie could ever have lifted against Earth
gravity, they left Tycho Station and moved toward the fringe of that
lunar hemisphere which is never seen from Terra&mdash;though it is no
different from the visible half in general character.</p>

<p>Wherever their feet found a medium that would take an impression,
they left their trademark behind them. Copeland could brush a name
out with a glove; otherwise those names were about as permanent as
if carved from granite, for there was no wind to blow the dust, and no
rain to wash it away. Passing tractor-caravans would never blot out all
of the footprints. Not in ages of time.</p>

<p>"At least we got us a monument, Jess," Copeland said once, feeling
somewhat thrilled. "That's what guys out exploring and prospecting
need. A legend. A reputation."</p>

<p>Jess Brinker's eyes narrowed, making him look sinister. "Yeah,
Cope," he drawled. "But in my case it's a <i>counter</i>-reputation, with a
little of Robin Hood thrown in, to help blow the stink of my Old Man
off me. I want some friends and backing, so I can do what Dad really
wanted to do&mdash;though he was as much of a rogue as a saint. You
listening, Cope?"</p>

<p>Copeland kept his face stony. "Tell me what you want to, and then
stop," he said softly.</p>

<p>"Thanks," Brinker answered. "It doesn't matter too much that I can
guess who killed Pop, and would like to square things. Yeah, a hatchet-faced
ex-partner who turned pious and legal on the outside, after he
got the breaks. How old is that story, I wonder? ... It doesn't even rile
me terribly, knowing that Dad wasn't all crook, knowing he <i>believed</i>
his idea was good for everybody, and was trying to get funds to put it
across."</p>

<p>Brinker sighed and went on: "The idea is the <i>important</i> thing, Cope.
A place with trees and flowers, a city, maybe&mdash;an antidote for the
Moon's desolation. Anyone here feels the need in his bones and nerves.
But it would take more air and water than could ever be imported, or
drawn from the lunar crust. You wouldn't know it on the dead surface,
but two hundred miles deep in the Moon there's still molten lava,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
plentiful water in the form of steam, volcanic carbon-dioxide gas&mdash;the
makings of oxygen. There's nitrogen, too.</p>

<p>"How to reach that stuff is the question. Drills break under the pressure
of depth at a tenth of the distance. Pop's idea involved Brulow's
Comet, which will be coming back sunward from far space in three
years. Imagine&mdash;a comet! It could be dangerous, too; nobody could
ever get permission for an attempt."</p>

<p>Brinker paused again. Copeland and he were plodding through a
jagged valley. The stars were merciless pinpoints, the silence brittle
and grating.</p>

<p>"But there must be a way of blasting down to those life-giving raw-materials,
Cope," Brinker continued. "Maybe with atomic explosive.
Experiments call for funds and backing. So I save my money, and wish
I had a head for making it faster. And I look for weak spots in the
lunar crust with radar. And I try to get people to know I'm around,
and to like me..."</p>

<p>Copeland realized that what he had just heard could be a line of
malarky meant to kid a yokel, or a bid to get him involved in something.
But he found himself kind of falling for the yarn. More than ever
he suspected that folks were wrong about Jess Brinker; his warning
instincts were being lulled to sleep.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<div class="cap extraspacetop">MONTH-LONG lunar days passed, while the two men ranged over a
segment of the hidden hemisphere. They trod plains and crater-walls
unsullied by human feet before; they took photographs to be sold
to the Lunar Topographical Commission; they located deposits of
radioactive metals, which could be registered for investigation by an
assaying party, and for possible royalties. Periodically they visited
scattered supply stations, and then set out once more.</div>

<p>Such a life had its poisons even for Brinker and Copeland, who were
braced for meeting the unknown and the strange.</p>

<p>Living in space suits for weeks at a time; smelling their own unwashed
bodies; slipping an arm out of a heavy sleeve to draw food through a
little airlock in their armor's chestplate; knowing, in spite of effective
insulation, that the heat of day exceeded the boiling point of water,
and that the cold of the protracted night, when usually they continued
their explorations with the aid of ato-lamps, hovered at the brink of
absolute zero&mdash;all those things had a harsh effect on nervous-systems.</p>

<p>They found two human corpses. One had been crushed in a long fall,
his spacesuit ripped open; he was a blackened mummy. The other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
was a freckled youth, coffined in his armor. Failure of its air-rejuvenator
unit had caused asphyxia. What you did for guys like this was collect
their credentials for shipment home.</p>

<p>Copeland also found a Martian&mdash;inside its transparent version of
a spacesuit, for the ancient Moon had been much the same as now. The
being was dead, of course. Its brain-case had been a sac; its tentacles
were like a snarl of age-hardened leather thongs.</p>

<p>Lying near it was an even greater rarity&mdash;the remains of a different
sort of monster from the planet that had been literally exploded in a
war with Mars, to form the countless fragments that were the asteroids.
That much of remote history was already known from the research-expeditions
that had gone out to the Red Planet, and beyond.</p>

<p>The queer, advanced equipment of these two beings from two small,
swift-cooling worlds&mdash;which had borne life early, and whose cultures
had rivalled briefly for dominance of the solar system until they had
wiped each other out those fifty million years ago&mdash;lay scattered near
them. It was still as bright and new as yesterday, preserved by the
Moon's vacuum: Cameras, weapons, instruments&mdash;rich loot, now, to
be sold to labs that sought to add the technology of other minds to
human knowledge.</p>

<p>For a year, things went well. The names, BRINKER and COPELAND,
footprinted into the lunar dust, helped build the new reputation that
Brinker wanted. Copeland and he were a hard-working team; they
covered more ground than any other Moon explorers.</p>

<p>The fights that Brinker got into with other toughs at the various
supply stations, and never lost, added to the legend&mdash;that old Tom's
son was savage and dangerous, but with a gentler side. For instance he
once carried a crazed Moon-tramp, whom Copeland was too slight to
have handled for a minute, fifty miles on his back to a station. Oh,
sure&mdash;the stunt could be pure ballyhoo, not charity. But Copeland
knew that more and more people had begun to admire his buddy.</p>

<p>Brinker never found a weak spot in the lunar crust. "It's always
about two hundred miles deep, Cope," he said. "Lots thicker than
Earth's shell, because the Moon, being smaller, cooled more. But don't
worry; nothing is impossible. Soon I'll have enough money to make
minor tests. And maybe enough friends for serious support."</p>

<p>Yeah&mdash;maybe it was all just a brain-bubble. But Copeland had
seen enough of desolation to grind the spirit of the Brinker idea into
his bones&mdash;even if he didn't think it was quite practical.</p>

<p>"I'll throw my dough in with yours, Jess," he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Their named bootprints helped build their fame as explorers; but
there was a flaw and an invitation here which they both must have
realized&mdash;and still faced as a calculated risk.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<div class="cap extraspacetop">A LUNAR day later, they were plodding through the Fenwick
mountains on the far hemisphere, when streams of bullets made
lava chips fly.</div>

<p>As they flopped prone in the dust, a scratchy voice chuckled:
"Hello, Brinker. Maybe you and your pal want my bunch to escort
you back to Tycho Station. We might as well have the reward. Robbery
of a minerals caravan and three killings, they say. It's terrible how you
scatter your tracks around..."</p>

<p>Brinker grasped Copeland's wrist to form a sound-channel, so that
they could converse without using their radiophones. "That was Krell
talking," he said. "Dad's old partner."</p>

<p>Luckily, it was not many hours to sunset. The mountain ridges,
slanting up to the peaks, cast inky shadows that could hide anything.
Brinker was canny; while more bullets spurted, he led a dash back
to a ridge-shadow that went clear to the range-crest. Even with bulky
packs, climbing was a lot faster than on Earth, where things weigh six
times as much.</p>

<p>So they got away, over the mountains. The black night of the far
side of the Moon, where Earth never shines, hid them.</p>

<p>"Making boot-soles with our names on them," Brinker growled bitterly,
using the radiophone at reduced range. "The crudest kind of
frameup."</p>

<p>"Your Krell is quite a man," Copeland stated.</p>

<p>"He <i>could</i> have arranged all of it&mdash;sure," Brinker answered. "He
knows I suspect that he finished Pop, so I'm dangerous to him. He
might hate me, too, as part of my Old Man&mdash;sort of ... Whatever it
was he got sore about, originally&mdash;money or principle, no doubt ...
Besides, I don't think he wants the Moon to be a little more livable.
It would encourage too many colonists to come, increase metals
production, spoil prices, cheapen his claims. He's a corny man, with
all the corny reasons ...</p>

<p>"He, and some of his guys, could have robbed and killed and left
footprints like ours. But any other lugs, seeking someone else to blame
for their crimes, could have done all that. If that is so, Krell has got
me even <i>legally</i>&mdash;without blame to himself."</p>

<p>"Footprints!" Copeland snapped. "They're so obviously a frame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
that it's silly; anyone could see that! Another thing&mdash;maybe Krell
was kidding, scaring us by saying that we are wanted. Tell you what,
Jess: In any case I won't seem as guilty as you; I'll go back alone
to Tycho Station, and clear us both."</p>

<p>"You're an optimist, ain't you?" Brinker laughed. "Krell wasn't
kidding; and in a rough place like the Moon, justice jumps to conclusions
and gets mean, fast. Sure, the purpose of the footprints is
obvious. But I've been fighting uphill against my Old Man's reputation
for a long time. Who's gonna say I haven't backslid? What I want to
accomplish is tough enough with everything in my favor."</p>

<p>Brinker's voice was now a sinister rumble with a quiver in it. Arne
Copeland turned wary again; he had never lost entirely the deepseated
notion that Brinker might cause him misfortune.</p>

<p>"So now what?" he demanded softly, flashing his ato-light beam
against Brinker's face-window, so that he could see his expression.
Copeland meant to forestall danger aggressively.</p>

<p>But as the darkness between them was swept aside, he also saw
the muzzle of Brinker's pistol levelled at him. The bigger man's grin
was lopsided. "I'd give you my neck, Cope," he rumbled. "But I'd
give both our necks for you-know-what. Now, because that's all there's
left, I'm gonna try it Pop's crazy way. You're gonna help. If you and I
can last through a couple of years of <i>real</i> silence and solitude, it
might have a chance. I got a ship hidden. Give me your gun. Easy!
If you think I wouldn't shoot, you're a fool. Now I'll wire one of your
wrists to mine; we've got a long march ahead."</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<div class="cap extraspacetop">SOME march it was! Copeland was fiercely independent. The warnings
about Brinker had gone to waste; so had his own wariness. Bitterness
made him savage. The harshness of the Moon still ached in his guts&mdash;he
wanted the steam and gases of its interior tapped and used, yes&mdash;but
by some reasonable means. Jess Brinker must be truly Moon-balmy,
now. Desolation-nuts. Wild for the sight of growing things. Else how
could he think seriously of using Brulow's Comet? Was it hard to
guess how? Copeland knew that he and Brinker had courage, and
willingness to work for a sound purpose. But to trade long effort and
hardship in a proposition that courted suicide, even in its probable
failure&mdash;and wide destruction if it managed to be successful&mdash;was
worse than folly.</div>

<p>So, when these meanings became clear in his mind, he wrestled
Brinker at every turn. Twice he almost won. He argued and cursed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
getting nowhere. He defied Brinker to shoot him. The big man didn't
do that. But at last Brinker jabbed a hypodermic needle&mdash;part of the
regulation medical kit&mdash;through the flexible rubberized fabric of the
elbow-joint of Copeland's spacesuit, and into his arm.</p>

<p class="extraspacetop">Many hours later, and many miles farther into the mountainous
country, Copeland awoke in a cavern with glassy walls, illuminated
by Brinker's ato-light. Brinker stood near where he lay. He seemed
just grimly good-humored.</p>

<p>"This is an old Martian supply depot, Cope," he offered. "I found
it before I knew you, and I kept it in reserve for possible trouble,
like now. I knew I could convert its contents to considerable money
at any time. So it was like a bank-account, and a last resort, too. There's
even a small Martian spaceship; only three others have ever been
found, intact. I also cached some Earthly instruments here. You can
bet I didn't leave <i>any</i> tracks for miles around."</p>

<p>Copeland's gaze caught the errie gleam of the strange little craft.
He saw the stacks of oddly-made boxes and bales. His hackles rose
as he thought of a senseless plunge into unplumbed distance.</p>

<p>"Unwire my hands, Jess!" he coaxed again, trying to control fury.
"Get wise! Damn you&mdash;you're more dangerous as an altruist than any
crook could be!"</p>

<p>Brinker's laugh was sharp, but his eyes held real apology. "Want to
help me ready and load the ship?" he said almost mildly. "No&mdash;I
guess not; you aren't quite in a cooperative frame of mind, yet. I'll
need you later. Sorry, but you're the only guy around, Cope."</p>

<p>Brinker blasted queer bulkheads out of the ship, in order to make
it habitable for humans. The exit of the cavern had been masked with
debris, but now he cleared it. He tossed Copeland aboard and took
off into the lunar night.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<div class="cap extraspacetop">THE vast journey lasted for months. Once Brinker said to his sullen,
and again partially-drugged, captive: "Maybe in two years, if we're
very lucky, we'll be back."</div>

<p>Hurtling outward, they passed the orbits of Mars, the asteroids,
Jupiter, and Saturn. There, with Earth-made instruments, Brinker
located what he sought: Brulow's Comet.</p>

<p>So far from the sun, where the fluorescence-inducing radiations were
thinned almost to nothing, it glowed hardly at all. And it had almost
no tail; it was only a gigantic, tenuous ghost, with a core of stone and
magnetic iron fragments.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Still dazed, Copeland thought about comets. Wanderers, following
elongated orbits that loop tight around the sun at one end and plumb
the depths of space at the other. Of all large forms moving through
the void, they were the least dense. In coma and tail, they were only
intensely rarefied and electrified gas. The great enigma about them was
that things so deficient in mass and gravity could hold onto even that
much atmosphere for long. Perhaps new gases were baked out of the
meteoric core, each time a comet was close to the sun; maybe some
of them even renewed their atmosphere periodically, by capturing a
little of the tenuous substance of the solar corona, during their very
near approaches to it.</p>

<p>Brulow's Comet was on the sunward swing, now, gaining speed
under solar gravitation; but it still had a long ways to go. Brinker
guided the ship down through its coma and toward its lazily-rotating
nucleus, where thousands of fragments of iron and rock swirled around
their common center of gravity.</p>

<p>The chunks clattered against the craft's metal hull, but did no
damage at their low speed. Brinker brought the ship to rest at the
center of the nucleus, where there was one solid mass of material a
hundred yards in diameter.</p>

<p>"Well, we're here, Cope," Brinker said grimly. "We don't have
to work right away&mdash;if you don't want to. We've got too much time."</p>

<p>Those two years looming ahead were the worst. If the Moon had
been harsh, it was nothing to this eerie place. The heart of this small
comet was illumined by faint, shifting phosphorescence, ranging from
blue and tarnished silver to delicate if poisonous pink. Perhaps the
cause was the same as that of the terrestrial aurora. The silence here
was that of space; but the swirling motion of the nucleus suggested a
continuous maddening rustle to Copeland.</p>

<p>He had to yield to Brinker's wishes. Toil might divert him some,
keep him from feeling the tension of time and strangeness so much.</p>

<p>"Okay, Brinker," he said. "You win. Brulow's Comet is headed for
a close approach to the Earth-Moon system. So you want to be
spectacular, and shift it a little from its orbit&mdash;so that it will hit the
Moon and maybe break its crust. Was that so hard to figure? That
sounds pretty big, doesn't it? But I'll humor you. Let's see how far
we get ... Since we're here." His sarcasm was tired.</p>

<p class="extraspacetop">As a preliminary, they cut a cavern in the central mass of the
nucleus with Martian blasters, and fitted it with a crude airlock. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
cavern would be better to live in than the interior of a ship meant
for alien beings. They moved Martian apparatus and supplies into it:
Air-rejuvenators, moisture-reclaimers, cylinders of oxygen and water,
and containers of nourishment&mdash;all millions of years old.</p>

<p>Their remaining supply of Earthly food in their packs was now
very short. It was weird&mdash;eating what had been preserved so long ago,
on another world, for beings just barely close enough to human for
their food to be edible. Gelatins, sectional fragments of vegetation,
and what might have been muscle-tissue. Copeland and Brinker both
gagged often. It wasn't the bland, oily taste so much, but the idea....</p>

<p>Some of it, Copeland decided, was not native Martian. It was more
like terrestrial fish. And slabs of coarse meat might have been flesh of
the last dinosaurs! Martians surely must have visited Earth briefly,
though evidence there had long since weathered away.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<div class="cap extraspacetop">WHILE the still-distant sun sent thin light into the comet, Brinker
and Copeland removed the propulsion-tubes from the ship and
welded them to the central chunk of the nucleus. They had a number
of other spare jet-tubes. These they fastened to lesser masses.</div>

<p>Whenever, in the slow swirling of the nucleus, tubes pointed in the
calculated proper direction at right angles to the comet's course, they
were fired in long bursts. Thus, slowly, like a perfectly-balanced bank
vault door moved by a finger, the mass of the comet&mdash;slight by volume,
but still measuring many thousands of tons&mdash;was deflected in the
opposite direction. Astrogation-instruments showed the shift. Copeland
had expected such coarse deflection to be possible; still, it startled him&mdash;this
was the moving of a celestial body!</p>

<p>"Just a little&mdash;for now, Cope," Brinker said. "We'll leave the fine
aiming for later. Meanwhile we've got to pass the time, stay as well
as we can, and keep our heads on straight."</p>

<p>Sure&mdash;straight! If Brinker hadn't turned foolish before they had
come, they wouldn't be out here at all. In a month they were already
thinning down from malnutrition and strain. At first, thinking coldly,
Copeland was sure they'd wilt and die long before they got near the
Moon.</p>

<p>Then, as they managed to steady themselves some by the diversions
of playing cards, and studying the intricacies of Martian equipment,
he began to fear once more that Brinker might succeed in his efforts&mdash;but
fail terribly in result.</p>

<p>Many times Copeland went over the same arguments, struggling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to speak calmly, and without anger: "I wonder if you realize it,
Brinker&mdash;with enough velocity one large meteor carries more energy
than a fission bomb. A whole comet would affect thousands of square
miles of the lunar surface, at least. Smash equipment, kill men. And
if the comet happened to miss the Moon and hit Earth&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sometimes Brinker's expression became almost fearful, as at an
enormity. But then he'd turn stubborn and grin. "There's plenty of
room to avoid hitting the Earth," he'd say. "On the Moon, astronomers
will warn of the shifted orbit of Brulow's Comet in plenty of time for
everybody to get out of danger. Most of what we've got to worry
about now, is our lives, or jail ..."</p>

<p>A moment later, as like as not, they'd be slamming at each other
with fists. Copeland found it hard to contain his fury for the man
who had brought him such trouble, and&mdash;without intent&mdash;was so
determined to extend it to many others.</p>

<p>Brinker kept winning the scraps. But Copeland's ten-year age-advantage
meant something when it came to enduring hardship and
partial-starvation over a long period. They didn't weaken equally.</p>

<p>This levelling of forces was one thing that Copeland waited for.
Another was that when Brulow's Comet was found to be off course, a
ship might be sent to investigate. He never mentioned it, certainly;
but once Brinker said: "I'm ready for what you're thinking, Cope.
I've got weapons."</p>

<p>By then they spent much of their time in torpid sleep.</p>

<p>Another difficulty was that it was getting harder to keep one's mind
consistently on the same track. Space, tribulation, and the months,
were having their blurring effect.</p>

<p>Often, Copeland spent many hours in wistful reverie about his girl,
Frances, in Iowa. Sometimes he hated all people&mdash;on Earth, Moon,
and everyhere, and didn't care what happened to them. On other
occasions Brinker's basic desire to lessen the desolation of the lunar
scene looked supremely good to him&mdash;as of course it always had, in
principle. Then, briefly and perhaps madly, he was Brinker's pal, instead
of yearning to beat him to a pulp.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<div class="cap extraspacetop">SOMEHOW, twenty months crept by, and the first spaceship hove
inquisitively close to Brulow's Comet. A shadow of his former self,
Brinker crept out of the cavern to man his weapons. But like a famished
beast seeking prey, Copeland followed him.</div>

<p>His victory, now, was almost easy. Then all he had to do was wait<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to be picked up; the ship was coming nearer. Through the now much-brightened
glow of the comet, it had ceased to be a planetlike speck
reflecting sunlight; and showed its actual form.</p>

<p>Confusion whirled in Copeland's head; hunger gnawed in him. Yet
he looked down at Brinker&mdash;poor Brinker, beaten unconscious inside
his spacesuit. Brinker had tried to fight lifeless dreariness. Copeland,
weak of body and fogged of mind, was now close to maudlin tears.
Dreariness was the enemy&mdash;here as elsewhere. He tried to think; his
stubborn nature mixed itself with splinters of reason, and seemed to
make sense.</p>

<p>His twenty months of suffering out here had to be used&mdash;mean
something&mdash;didn't it? It couldn't be just a futile blank. You had to
follow a thing started through to the end, didn't you? Brinker wanted
to improve the Moon, which certainly needed that. Okay&mdash;finish the
job that had gone so far. Damn desolation everywhere! Fight it! Smash
it! Sudden rage made Copeland's thin blood pound. Dimly he realized
that he was driven by the same dreariness-disease that motivated
Brinker. So what? Who cared about smashed lunar equipment, after
all. And beside experience, prison would be paradise.</p>

<p>Copeland fired a Martian rocket-launcher, aiming behind the ship.
He saw the blaze of atomic fission. Jets flaming, the craft fled.</p>

<p>In his phones he heard a voice that he remembered: "That you,
Brinker? Trying your father's trick, eh? Idiot! You'll kill yourself, or
be executed. And now you even shoot!"</p>

<p>Fury at Krell clinched Copeland's decision. He did not answer him.
But when Brinker woke up he said savagely, without friendship or
forgiveness, yet with cooperation: "We're on the same side, now.
Let's aim Brulow's Comet."</p>

<p>Concentrating was hard, but they had their instruments and calculators.
Velocity, position, and course of both comet and Moon had
to be coordinated to make them arrive in the same place at the same
moment. It was a problem in astrogation, but a comet was not as easily
directed as a space ship. Copeland had once thought that the necessary
fine guiding couldn't be done. The jet-system they had rigged in that
inconveniently whirling nucleus was crude.</p>

<p>But one thing was in their favor; they had ample time. They could
adjust their course with the jets, check with instruments, and re-adjust&mdash;again
and again. Copeland found himself doing the vital part of the job;
he was better at math than Brinker.</p>

<p>They still had plenty of Martian food left&mdash;for what it was worth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to human insides. Perhaps unified purpose and action brightened their
outlook a little, helping their bodies. They could never work very
long&mdash;even in the almost total absence of gravity. But&mdash;at least&mdash;their
weakness wasn't increasing now.</p>

<p>During those last four months they drove several ships away. Earth
and Moon swelled to spheres, ahead. Brulow's Comet lengthened its
tail under increased solar light-pressure. Intensified radiation made its
shifting colors glorious.</p>

<p>Brinker and Copeland lined their gigantic missile up on its target
as perfectly as they could. Fifty hours before the crash was due, they
smashed most of the jets. The remaining ones they tried, feebly, to
refit into their ship, meaning thus to escape.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<div class="cap extraspacetop">THREE Space Patrol craft showed up, and they had to man their
weapons. Copeland hated to be an outlaw; but now he could not
see effort brought to nothing. Brinker and he had survived so far,
accomplishing much&mdash;far better results than he had expected; it made
him surer that their purpose was generally sound.</div>

<p>More missiles were fired carefully&mdash;not to do damage, but to
discourage the intruders; the latter were held at bay for another twelve
hours. Copeland and Brinker left radio commands and threats unanswered,
so it was hard for their opponents to get a fix on their
position in the whirling nucleus.</p>

<p>Explosions blazed around them, but never very close. Masses of
iron and stone were shattered and half vaporized, cooling subsequently
to fine dust. The nucleus of Brulow's Comet expanded a bit under the
battering that went on within it.</p>

<p>At an opportune moment, Copeland and Brinker clung to one of
their jet-tubes and, gunning it very lightly, rode it from the central
core-mass of the nucleus to a lesser meteor, and hid in a cleft. A dust-poll
had concealed their change of position. And now, with so many
other large meteors around them, they would be almost impossible to
find.</p>

<p>They glimpsed the Patrol craft invading the heart of the comet.
Men poured forth, struggling to set up jets in the hope of still deflecting
this juggernaut from the Moon. But the comet was already much too
close; before the setting-up was half completed it had to be abandoned.
Still, the ships remained almost to the last.</p>

<p>Copeland wondered tensely if they'd ever go. His withered palms
perspired.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"We could still yell for help&mdash;have them take us off," Brinker
suggested when they had left. He spoke by sound-channel contact.</p>

<p>The Moon loomed huge and ugly ahead. Copeland gave it a scared
glance, and then laughed grimly. "Ironic, that would be," he snapped,
"No&mdash;we've got this jet to ride, and we're still at liberty."</p>

<p>From space, lashed to the flaming propulsion tube, they saw the
crash happen. It was a terrific spectacle. Copeland's hopes now had
jagged cracks of worry. The comet seemed to move slowly, its coma
flattening over the Moon's spaceward hemisphere. There were blinding
flashes as the chunks of its nucleus bit into the lunar crust, their energy
of velocity converting largely to heat. Then dust masked the region
of impact. The comet's tail collapsed over the Moon like a crumbling
tower.</p>

<p>Copeland gulped. He saw that Brinker had gone limp&mdash;fainted.
Weakness was enough to cause that; but the fact of a plan carried out
had a shock in it, too.</p>

<p>Copeland worked the jury-rigged controls of the jet, continuing to
decelerate. At spotty intervals, under the terrible thrust of reducing
speed, he was unconscious, too.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<div class="cap extraspacetop">THERE was no such thing as picking a landing-spot. Checking
velocity soon enough, so close to the Moon, took all of the propulsion
tube's power&mdash;so he just followed the comet down. Almost at a stand-still
at last, balanced on a streamer of flame, he toppled into hot dust
Feebly he worked to unlash himself from the tube. Brinker, jolted
back to semi-consciousness, managed to do the same.</div>

<p>Weakened and spent, they could not even lift themselves against
the slight lunar gravity for a while.</p>

<p>The darkness around them was Stygian. But as more dust settled,
the sky cleared, and the normal stars of the lunar night blazed out.
Their attention was drawn in one direction inevitably.</p>

<p>Red-hot lava glowed there, in scattered areas over what was clearly
an extensive expanse of territory. White vaporous plumes spurted
high above the ground, and against the sides of new-formed meteor-craters,
a white layer was collecting.</p>

<p>Copeland staggered erect. "Frost and snow!" he stammered. "From
volcanic steam! The first frost and snow on the Moon in a billion
years! We've done it, Brinker! Brulow's Comet really did crack the
thick lunar crust...."</p>

<p>He heard Brinker's grunt of premature enthusiasm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The Patrol picked them up hours later, wandering dazedly. They
were emaciated ghosts of men&mdash;almost skeletons in armor. They
gave their names, but didn't really come to their senses until the
prison doctor in Tycho Station treated them, and they had slept for
a long time.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, fellas. Relax," he said&mdash;with fury in his eyes.</p>

<p>Other faces were grim.</p>

<p class="extraspacetop">At the speedy trial in Tycho Station, sharp-featured Krell was among
many who flung accusations.</p>

<p>"In the impact-zone itself&mdash;an area a hundred miles across&mdash;mining
installations and machinery of tremendous value were utterly destroyed,"
he said. "But lesser damage extends to a far wider circle.
Thousands of claims have been buried in dust, till much of the far
lunar hemisphere will have to be resurveyed. Luckily, miners and explorers
were warned in time, and sought safety. But the charge of
wholesale vandalism&mdash;terrible enough&mdash;does not stand alone.
These men are to be remembered as accused robbers and murderers."</p>

<p>In rebuttal, Brinker's defiance was a little uncertain, as if under so
much blame, he had lost his assurance.</p>

<p>"Men who know the Moon know that its barrenness is poison, and
not right for people!" he growled. "I tried to change it with Brulow's
Comet&mdash;when I had no success by other means. Anyway, Copeland
is blameless. I forced him to help me."</p>

<p>Embitted, there was no warmth in Copeland for his older codefendant
and jinx. Still, even without Brinker's attempt to shield him, he would
have been loyal.</p>

<p>"During all important parts of mine and Jess Brinker's joint project,"
he told the court, "I was in full agreement with his purpose."</p>

<p>Their attorney accomplished one considerable victory before these
angry people. The charge of previous murders and robbery was barred;
it was admitted that footprints were easy to duplicate, and that the
presence of some bearing the names of the guilty was unlikely.</p>

<p>Brinker got fifty years in the mine-pits, and Copeland thirty.</p>

<p>"You always figured I might get you in a jam, didn't you, Cope?"
Brinker said. "I'll keep trying to fix that."</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<div class="cap extraspacetop">COPELAND found nothing to grin about, in a thirty-year sentence. It
was goodbye wandering, goodbye girls, goodbye everything. He'd get
out middle-aged, finished, and marked. He might as well stay another
twenty with Brinker&mdash;complete a sour association with him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></div>

<p>Copeland had another recent jolt to brood over. A bunch of old
letters from his Frances had been delivered to him. His inability to
receive or answer any of them had brought the worst result. She had
married another guy, and who could blame her?</p>

<p>Arne Copeland wanted to kill Brinker. Getting desolation-goofy, and
dragging him into this mess.</p>

<p>But from Brinker's infuriating grin, Copeland caught a hot spark
of hope, backed by reasoning.</p>

<p class="extraspacetop">Later, sweating in the penal mine-pits near Tycho Station, Brinker
and Copeland still heard scraps of news.</p>

<p>Explorers moved back into the region where the comet had split
the lunar crust. The rising columns of steam and gas were perhaps
unspectacular phenomena in themselves. But there they were, ready
to fill a tremendous need. The sleepy internal fires of the Moon were
unlikely to be violent. Yet they would push vapors up to the surface
here perhaps for centuries.</p>

<p>In balancing benefit against transient damage, was it necessary even
to mention that deeper and richer mineral deposits had been laid bare
for easy mining by the blast effect of the comet's downfall? All free
men&mdash;good or bad, and of large or small holdings&mdash;were set to gain,
Krell included. But better mines were a side-issue.</p>

<p>The prisoners soon heard how roofs of transparent, flexible plastic,
brought in bundles like fabric, were being reared over that smashed-up
region, to trap escaping volcanic vapors. One tentlike structure. Then
another and another.</p>

<p>Here was ample water from volcanic steam, and vast quantities of
carbon-dioxide from which ordinary air-rejuvenators could release
breathable oxygen. Men who had lived so long in the lunar silence
and barrenness, soon saw that these raw materials of life need not only
be used locally, but could be piped anywhere.</p>

<p>"Folks have caught on, Cope," Brinker said. "They were a little
desolation-balmy, too&mdash;hence on our side all the time. Now they'll
feel better about my Old Man. There'll be more than one city, I'll
bet&mdash;clusters of big, plastic air-bubbles, self-sealing against meteor-punctures,
warmed inside at night by volcanic heat. It won't happen
all at once, but it'll come. Seeds'll be planted, and houses built. Parts
of the Moon won't look the same."</p>

<p>Krell's death was part of the turning tide. He was found in Tycho
Station, head smashed by a boot-sole of metal; it was good that Brinker
was in prison, because his name was printed into Krell's skull.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Who did it? Neither Brinker nor Copeland cared very much. Some
wronged stooge of Krell's, no doubt. Let the forces of law figure out
the details.</p>

<p class="extraspacetop">Things got really good for Copeland and Brinker after popular
demand forced their vindication. They were feted, honored, praised,
rewarded. All Earth knew of them, and feminine colonists arriving as
part of a new phase of the Moon's development, shined up to them as
heroes.</p>

<p>It is not to be said that they didn't enjoy the advantages of fame.
Brinker said more than once: "Forget your Frances, Cope. Problems
are easy, these days."</p>

<p>The time came when Copeland growled in answer: "Sure&mdash;too
easy. Having a lot of pals after the need is gone. No&mdash;I'm not
criticizing. Most folks are swell. But I'd like to make friends and
maybe find love a little more naturally. I thought I'd stay on the Moon;
now I think I'll shove off for Mars. People are going there; whole
towns are being built, I understand. And there's plenty of room for a
lunar tramp, with a prison-record, to get lost ..."</p>

<p>Copeland chuckled at the end. His vagabond blood was singing.
He was also pitching a come-on at Brinker, for he'd seen him with
some letters while they were prisoners. Copeland had glimpsed the
name and address of the writer: Dorothy Wells, the big nurse that
Brinker had known at Tycho Station. She was in Marsport now.</p>

<p>"By gosh&mdash;I guess I'll go too, Cope!" Brinker rumbled.</p>

<p>Looking back, Brinker thought it sort of funny that they were pals.
He laughed.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
